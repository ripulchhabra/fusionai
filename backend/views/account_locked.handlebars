      I just wanted to let you know that something a bit ruff happened with your
      fetchrocket account. It seems like there were a few too many tries with
      your one-time password (OTP), which is an extra security step we use to
      keep your account safe. So, for safety's sake, we've put a temporary lock
      on it. Don't worry, though! Your account will be wagging its tail again in
      12 hours. And while we're at it, why not consider giving your password a
      little makeover? It's always good to keep things fresh and secure!

    <p>Sending you tail wags and belly rubs,</p>
    <p>Rocket 🐶</p>
