    <p>Hey {{name}},</p>
    
    <p>
      Woof woof! It's me, your friendly neighborhood pup Rocket, with some news: Your 
      subscription is officially taking a paws. 🐾
    </p>

    <p>
      I know, I know, change can be ruff sometimes, but we've got your back! Your 
      cancellation request has been fetched and processed. You're officially off the leash 
      from now on.
    </p>

    <p>
      Remember, if you ever feel like sniffing around for new adventures again, our door – or 
      should I say, our doggy door – is always open for you. Just give us a bark!
    </p>

    <p>Wishing you tail wags and belly rubs,</p>
    <p>The fetchrocket team  🐶</p>
